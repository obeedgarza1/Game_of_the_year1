# Game_of_the_year1

Project created from 0, starting with SQL then moving the information to Power BI to analyze data.

The games of the list were selected from the D.I.C.E. Awards to have more games to compare, the score column was chosen by the Metacritic website, a professional site that reviews games, and the sales were from VGChartz, a site where you can find all the information about it and more, I wanted to have uniform information for every game, so every sales number is from there and all scores are from Metacritic, this way having a fair comparison.
